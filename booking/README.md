This project is a Next.js 14 application created while following Sonny Sangha's [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnJ6EmCWA_Y&t=2116s). The tutorial covers building a clone of Booking.com, allowing users to search for accommodations based on location, date, and the number of people. The web scraping functionality is implemented using the Oxylabs webscraping API.

## Project Overview

- **Functionality:**
  - Users can input location, date, and the number of people.
  - Pressing the "Search" button triggers a web scraping process to fetch data from Booking.com.
  - Results are displayed on our app with direct links to Booking.com for more details.

## Learning Highlights

- Developed a Next.js 14 application.
- Implemented web scraping using the Oxylabs API.
- Created a simple yet functional clone of Booking.com
